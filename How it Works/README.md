How Puppet Works
======


### Easily get started with infrastructure automation
With Puppet you can start automating easily with an agentless task-based approach. You can move a step beyond from shareable scripts and leverage existing content on the Puppet Forge from your own workstation or laptop.


### Know what you have
With Puppet, you know what software you have, how, where, and why it changed, and who did it, all from one view. Always know what you have in your hybrid infrastructure so you can adapt to new technological challenges with confidence.


### Orchestrate change and applications intelligently 
Whether you schedule a change or push it out directly from HipChat, Git or Jenkins, or commit your next application update, Puppet gives you control, visibility, and automated intelligence to orchestrate change across your software and infrastructure.


### Ensure security & compliance, inherently
Puppet makes security and compliance inherent and automatic. With Puppet, you get the automation needed to continually enforce policies and the traceability required to prove compliance.
